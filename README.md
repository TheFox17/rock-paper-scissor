# rock-paper-scissors

As simple as it sounds, you are going to play with the computer a rock-paper-scissors game!

before you run the script make sure you run the command "pip install random"

run "python rock-paper-scissors.py" from the terminal

choose a letter; r stands for rock, p for paper, and s for scissor.

ENJOY!
